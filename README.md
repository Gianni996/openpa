====================
Java classes sub-module for Open Source Power Apps and Utilities

The goal of the API is to make model access simple and fast regardless of the back-end being used.

For details please check the [Javadoc](http://powerdata.github.io/com.powerdata.openpa) Reference.

PsseModel Usage
-----
To open a model use the *PsseModel.Open()* function.  The parameter to this function is a URI that
describes the back-end storage where the data will come from.  For example, to use a PSSE file named
*/tmp/palco.raw* directly:
```java
PsseModel eq = PsseModel.Open("psseraw:file=/tmp/palco.raw");
```
or to use a directory of psse CSV files named */tmp/testdata/db*:
```java
PsseModel eq = PsseModel.Open("pssecsv:path=/tmp/testdata/db");
```
This can even be extended to proprietary databases, for example:
```java
PsseModel eq = PsseModel.Open("pd2cim:db=/tmp/wecc.pddb&inputctx=Ots");
```
opens the model using the PD2 CIM database named */tmp/wecc.pddb*.

The main point is that the code doesn't need to change, only the URI string.
See URI details for the public model parameters below

Once we have the *PsseModel* object, *eq* in our examples, we can access lists of equipment.  For example,
to examine every line in the model you could use:
```java
for(Line line : eq.getLines())
{
    // the variable line will be set to the next line in the list
   ... do some work ...
    // at the end of the loop, when I hit the bracket '}' the line variable
    // becomes the next line and control goes back to the top of the loop.
}
```
Some equipment also has it's own lists.  For example, from the Line object we can access the fromBus()
and from the fromBus() we can find all of the breakers needed to isolate the bus (which of course would
isolate the line as well):
```java
Bus frombus = line.getFromBus();
SwitchList switches = frombus.isolate();
for(Switch s : switches)
{
    s.setState(SwitchState.Open);
}
```
By now you may have noticed that the model representation is based on PSS/e but is not exactly PSS/e:
* Included Switch detail as an extension to allow for more accurate representation of a poweer system.
* 3-winding transformers have been converted to an equivalent representation of 3 2-winding transformermers.
* Phase shifters are in a separate list
* Shunts that are identified as part of the Bus or NontransformerBranch record are listed in the ShuntList.
* SwitchedShunt segments are converted into individual entries in the ShuntList.

PsseModel URI description
--------------------

###psseraw
Load a PsseModel from a PSS/e raw file.  Currently supports versions 29 and 30.  The current implementation
converts the PSS/e file to a set of CSV files as a side effect.  The default behavior is to remove the temporary CSV files.
If desired, the temporary CSV files can be left behind using the keepcsv parameter.

*Parameters*
* file=/path/to/raw/file
* keepcsv=/path/to/destination/directory

*Example*
```java
PsseModel model = PsseModel.Open("psseraw:file=/tmp/palco.raw&keepcsv=/tmp/palcocsv");
```

###pssecsv
Loads a PsseModel from a set of CSV files based on the PSS/e format.  The temporary CSV files from the *psseraw* URI are generated
in the format appropriate for this model.  CSV files can be generated by hand or other methods.  Regardless of the PSS/e version 
of the source data, the CSV file parser currently supports version 30 objects and attributes.

*Parameters*
* path=/path/to/csv/files
